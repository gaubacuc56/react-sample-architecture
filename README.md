## Folder structure

```
src\
+---app-core            # global configurations

+---layout              # determines how template are arranged together to form a page or section of the application.
+---libs                # reusable libraries preconfigured for the application.
|   +---components      # base on Atomic desgin pattern.
|   |   +---shared      # combine atoms together to form components with specific functions (Molecules).
|   |   +---template    # independent interfaces capable of operating independently, consisting of Molecules and Atoms.
|   |   +---ui (atoms)  # most basic UI components and cannot be divided into smaller parts (Atoms).
|   +---dtos            # models of api's request & response.
|   +---features        # feature's data storage and api services.
|   +---hooks           # shared hooks used across the entire application
|   +---translation     # i18next dictionary
|   +---utils
|       +---helper      # shared utility functions
|       +---hoc         # app hoc component
